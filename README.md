# stopwatch

This repository holds the source code for a quite simple stopwatch mobile app. It developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). It has a single screen, which is the stopwatch itself. The app has a start/stop button, and a reset button.

The app follows the BloC pattern and uses the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) package to implement it. The [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) package is also used to simplify the implementation of BloC.

I was inspired to create this app after seeing this [BloC documentation's tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/fluttertimertutorial).
